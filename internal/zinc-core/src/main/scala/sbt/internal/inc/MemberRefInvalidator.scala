/**
 * Implements various strategies for invalidating dependencies introduced by member reference.
 *
 * The strategy is represented as a function String => Set[String] where the lambda's parameter is
 * a name of a class that other classes depend on. When you apply that function to a given
 * `className` you get a set of classes that depend on `className` by member reference and should
 * be invalidated due to the APIChange that was passed to a method constructing that function.
 * The center of design of this class is a question:
 *
 *    Why would we apply the function to any other `className` that the one that got modified
 *    and the modification is described by the APIChange?
 *
 * Let's address this question with the following example of code structure:
 *
 * class A
 *
 * class B extends A
 *
 * class C { def foo(a: A) = ??? }
 *
 * class D { def bar(b: B) = ??? }
 *
 * Member reference dependencies on A are B, C. When the api of A changes we consider B and C for
 * invalidation. However, B is also a dependency by inheritance on A so we always invalidate it.
 * The api change to A is relevant when B is considered (inheritance propagates changes to
 * members down the inheritance chain) so we would invalidate B by inheritance and then we would
 * like to invalidate member reference dependencies of B as well. In other words, we have a
 * function because we want to apply it (with the same api change in mind) to all classes
 * invalidated by inheritance of the originally modified class.
 *
 * The specific invalidation strategy is determined based on APIChange that describes a change to
 * the api of a single class.
 *
 * For example, if we get APIChangeDueToMacroDefinition then we invalidate all member reference
 * dependencies unconditionally. On the other hand, if api change is due to modified name hashes
 * of regular members then we'll invalidate sources that use those names.
